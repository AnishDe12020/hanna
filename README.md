## Get it!

You can get your own dashboard with these simple steps:

[![Deploy to
netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/hannalytics/hanna)

Netlify will ask to fork the repo on your GitHub account. Fork it, then Rename
the `.github.sample` folder to `.github`

Run the init.js script: `node --experimental-fetch init.js` (note: this requires
a recent version of nodejs)

Push your changes to GitHub, and verify if the GitHub action has started running
in the actions tab. If it runs, you are all set!
